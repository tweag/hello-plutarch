# [Hello Plutarch](https://github.com/tweag/hello-plutarch)

Hello Plutarch helps you writing projects in Haskell that use
[Plutarch](https://github.com/Plutonomicon/plutarch-plutus) libraries.

To start a new project based on Hello Plutarch, you need:
- nix
- a properly set up cache, see
  [here](https://input-output-hk.github.io/haskell.nix/tutorials/getting-started.html#setting-up-the-binary-cache)
  and [there](https://github.com/input-output-hk/plutus#how-to-set-up-the-iohk-binary-caches).

and then to test the setup,

```sh
$ nix run
(program 1.0.0 (\i0 -> \i0 -> \i0 -> ()))
```
